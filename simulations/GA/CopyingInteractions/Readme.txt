Run the file with the name 'MainFile.m' to carry out the GA simulations and analysis that returns the minimized KL divergence values and evaluated AIC.
GA optimization for identifying the optimal rates and the variance of noise, for model with Copying interactions.

Order=2- pairwise interactions
Order =3- contains pairwise and ternary interactions
