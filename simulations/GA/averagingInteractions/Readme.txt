Run the file with the name 'MainFile.m' to carry out the GA simulations and analysis that returns the minimized KL divergence values.
GA optimization for identifying the optimal rates and the variance of noise, for model with Averaging interactions.

K=1- same as pairwise interactions, K>1 averaging with K neighbours
